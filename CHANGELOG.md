### Breaking Changes

- node ≥14 is required

- The initializer code is not added to Parser->parse() anymore. Instead the code will be added to Parser and a method initialize() will be called if it is provided:
  ~~~diff
  class Parser
  {
  +   initializer code block
  +   it may contain
  +   function initialize() {...}
  +
      public function parse()
      {
          ...
  -       initializer code block
  +       if (method_exists($this, 'initialize')) {
  +           $this->initialize();
  +       }
          ...
      }
  }
  ~~~
